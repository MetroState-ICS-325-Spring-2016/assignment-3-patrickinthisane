You will need to import the classicmodels database from mysqlsampledatabase.sql
using MySQL workbench before you start working on this assignment.

For the questions, put your SQL query first and your output second.
For example,
Question:
How many customers have a credit limit over $20,000?

Answer:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `customers` WHERE `creditLimit` > 20000;
97

1. How many customers are located in Germany? (Should return only 1 field with the count.)
select count(*) from customers where country = 'germany';
13

2. What is the contact first name and contact last name for every contact that has a first name that starts with D?
select contactFirstName, contactLastName from customers where contactFirstName like 'D%';

contactFirstName contactLastName
Diego 	Freyre
Dean	Cassidy
Daniel	Da Silva
Daniel 	Tonini
Dorothy	Young
Dominique	Perrier
Dan	Lewis

3. What are the customer names for every company that Leslie Tompson is a sales rep for?
select customerName from customers
inner join employees
on customers.salesRepEmployeeNumber = employees.employeeNumber
where employees.lastName = 'thompson' and employees.firstname ='leslie';
customerName
Signal Gift Stores
Toys4GrownUps.com
Boards & Toys Co.
Collectable Mini Designs Co.
Men 'R' US Retailers, Ltd.
West Coast Collectables Co.

4. What was the amount for the last payment that Boards & Toys Co. made? (Should return only 1 field with the amount.)
Probably not the most effective way but it works:
select payments.amount from payments
inner join customers on customers.customerNumber = payments.customerNumber
where customers.customerName = 'Boards & Toys Co.'
order by paymentDate desc limit 1

amount
3452.75

5. How many payments have been made that are more than 20000? (Should return 1 field with the count.)
select count(amount) from payments where amount > 20000

count(amount)
195

6. Write a PHP program that prints the following information to the terminal:
The customer name, country, and sales rep name on one line per customer.
Order the results by country first and customer name second.
See assignment_3_solution_output.txt for what the output should look like.
assignment_3.php contains most of the code you need to complete the assignment.
You will need to write the SQL query and write the output.
You should use only 1 SQL query to the database.

Problems 1 through 5 are worth 10 points each.
Problem 6 is worth 40 points.
The total number of points for the assignment is 90.

Point breakdown for problem 6:
10 points - 1 SQL query
10 points - correct output format (see assignment_3_solution_output.txt)
 5 points - correct data from the customers table
 5 points - correct data from the employees table
 5 points - order by country first
 5 points - order by customer name second
